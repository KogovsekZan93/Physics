% Supposedly one wishes to determine the average heat loss 
% thought the walls of a building in the shape of a rectangular 
% cuboid (i.e. a box), which is determined by the equation 
% P = s * delT * Lambda = (2 * a * b + 2 * a * c + b * c) * 
% (T_Inside – T_Outside) * Lambda. s is the total surface area 
% of the walls the, delT is the temperature difference between 
% the inside temperature T_Inside and outside temperature 
% T_Outside, Lambda is the heat coefficient, a is the hight of the 
% building, b is the width of the building, and c is the length of 
% the building.
