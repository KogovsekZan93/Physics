# Welcome to the distribution-propagation function package
This function package has two main functions: the 
FindOutputVariableAvgCovarMat function and the 
FindOutputVariableAvgStd function. Provided the information about the 
distribution of the values of the input variables of an arbitrary function 
f, the two main functions of this function package provide the information 
about the distribution of the values of the output variables of the 
function f. By appropriately tailoring the function of which the 
distribution of the output variables is in question, the two main 
functions of this function package can be used for a wide variety of 
functions. 

# The tutorials
The generality of the main functions of this function package comes with 
the cost of them being demanding on the users, more so with the less 
experienced ones, which is why going through the 
DistributionPropagationTutorial tutorial script, found in the tutorial 
folder is a definite must for new users. 

# DistributionPropagationTestScript
The DistributionPropagationTestScript script is the test script which can 
be used upon changing the code to check whether it still performs as 
intended. If there are no error messages after running the test script, it 
can be assumed, that the functions perform as intended. Because the output 
values of the two main functions of this function package are random in 
nature, errors can occur even when the functions perform as intended. For 
this reason, if there are errors, the test script should be run again to 
check for consistency of error messages. 

# Subfunctions
The subfunctions folder contains functions which are essential for the two 
main function of this function package. They can be used individually for 
specific tasks. However, as there is no tutorial for them, the way they 
operate has to be inferred by studying their code and/or documentation. 


# Installation of the distribution-propagation function package
On the "Home" tab, in the Environment section, click the "Set Path" 
button. The "Set Path" dialog box opens, listing all folders in the search 
path. 
Now, click the "Add with Subfolders…" button in the dialog box. The "Add 
to path with Subfolders" dialog box opens. 
Now, search the "distribution-propagation" folder by single-clicking it 
and then click the "Select Folder" button thereby closing the "Add to path 
with Subfolders" dialog box. 
Now, in the "Set Path" dialog box, click the "Move to Bottom" button in 
the "Set Path" dialog box. 
Now, select the "tutorial" folder (it should be at the bottom of the list) 
and click the "Remove" button, then click the "Save" button, and then 
click the "Close" button. 

You have now completed the installation.
