# Welcome to the fit-derivative-integral-propagation function 
package
This function package contains three scripts which work as 
examples as well as templates for the combined use of the 
functions of the distribution-propagation function package and 
the fit-differentiate-integrate function package. 

For the use of the three scripts, the two mentioned function 
packages must first be installed (instruction to do so are in the 
README files of the respective function packages). 

Each of the three scripts serves as a template/example for use 
of the ZFindIndefiniteIntegral function, the ZFindDerivative 
function, and the ZFindFit function, respectively, of the 
fit-differentiate-integrate function package in combination with the 
FindOutputVariableAvgStd function of the 
distribution-propagation function package. The scripts can be run 
directly. They are also divided into sensible sections for easier 
understanding of the flow of code. 

The functions of this function package were written for purposes 
of the three scripts of this function package, which call them.
