# Welcome to the miscellaneous function package
This function package contains a mix of functions, who can be 
used in synergy with the functions of many other function 
packages of the Physics suppository but do not strictly belong to 
any specific function package. 

# The functions

The PlotHorizontalErrorbar function is a function NOT written by 
Žan Kogovšek. It is the equivalent of the MATLAB errorbar 
function for plotting vertical error bars at plot points. 

The GetCustomDistribution function can be used to generate a 
vector of variable values, the frequency of each is proportional to 
its value of the arbitrary user-defined probability density function 
of the aforementioned variable. 
The vector of values can be used directly as an element of the 
input 'InputVariablesDistributionInfo' cell array of either the 
FindOutputVariableAvgStd function or the 
FindOutputVariableAvgCovarMat function of the 
distribution-propagation function package to provide information 
about the probability density function of the aforementioned 
variable. 

# MiscellaneousTestScript
The MiscellaneousTestScript script is the test script which can 
be used upon changing the code to check whether it still 
performs as intended. If there are no error messages after 
running the test script, it can be assumed that the functions 
perform as intended. 

# Installation of the miscellaneous function package
On the "Home" tab, in the Environment section, click the 
"Set Path" button. The "Set Path" dialog box opens, listing all 
folders in the search path. 
Now, click the "Add with Subfolders…" button in the dialog box. 
The "Add to path with Subfolders" dialog box opens. 
Now, search the "miscellaneous" folder by single-clicking it and 
then click the "Select Folder" button thereby closing the "Add to 
path with Subfolders" dialog box. 
Now, in the "Set Path" dialog box, click the "Move to Bottom" 
button in the "Set Path" dialog box. 
Now, in the "Set Path" dialog box, click the "Save" button, and 
then click the "Close" button. 

You have now completed the installation.
