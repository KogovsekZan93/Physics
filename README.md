# Physics
This repository contains some useful tools for solving problems related to physics and engineering. 

# Completed packages
Ready for use are 
- the fit-differentiate-integrate function package, 
- the distribution-propagation function package, 
- the simple-linear-regression function package, and 
- the fit-derivative-integral-propagation function package. 
The miscellaneous function package is continually being updated but is ready for use as is. 
The legacy folder contains pieces of code on which some of the functions of various function packages are modeled. 

Provided the data points of a unidimensional function Y = f(X), the fit-differentiate-integrate function package offers various functions for estimating the values of the function, and its integral and derivative values at arbitrary values of the dependent variable X. 

Provided the information about the distribution of the values of the input variables of an arbitrary function f, the two main function of the distribution-propagation function package provide the information about the distribution of the values of the output variables of the function f. 

Provided the data points of a linear function, the functions of the simple-linear-regression function package can be used to estimate the slope and the intercept of the linear function as well as the covariance of both the data as well as the parameters of the linear function. Another function can be used to plot the estimated linear function as well as its standard deviation area. 

The fit-derivative-integral-propagation function package contains scripts and functions which serve as an example and template for the combined used of the functions of the fit-differentiate-integrate function package and the distribution-propagation function package. 

The miscellaneous function package contains useful functions which could not be appropriately placed into any other function package.
