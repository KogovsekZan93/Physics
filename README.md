# Completed packages
So far, only the fit-differentiate-integrate function package is fully ready for use, the other packages are a work in progress. 
Provided the data points of a unidimensional function Y = f(X), the fit-differentiate-integrate function package offers various functions for estimating the values of the function, and its integral and derivative values at arbitrary values of the dependent variable X.
