# Welcome to the fit-differentiate-integrate function package
Provided the data vectors "xData" and "yData" of some arbitrary 
function f (Y = f(X), yData = f(xData)), this function package can 
be used to estimate the values of either the function f, its definite 
or indefinite integral, or its derivative at the desired values of the 
X variable. 

# The tutorials
The tutorials file provides the three tutorials for estimating the 
value of the f function, its definite or indefinite integral, or its 
derivative, respectively. Each tutorial contains pages with 
instructions, each followed by one or more block of code, each 
bordered by empty lines, which can be copied and pasted into 
the command line and run as examples of use of the functions of 
the fit-differentiate-integrate function package. 

# FitDifferentiateIntegrateTestScript
FitDifferentiateIntegrateTestScript is the test scrip which can be 
used if changing the code to see if it still performs as intended. If 
there are no error messages after running the test script, it can 
be assumed, that the functions perform as intended. 

# Subfunctions
The subfunctions file contains functions which are essential for 
the use of the four ZFind... functions located in this file. Many of 
them can be used individually for specific tasks or to optimize 
performance in individual cases but are less user friendly and 
there is no tutorial for them, so how they operate has to be 
inferred by studying their code and/or documentation. 

# Installation of fit-differentiate-integrate
On the “Home” tab, in the Environment section, click the 
“Set Path” button. The “Set Path” dialog box opens, listing all 
folders in the search path. 
Now, click the “Add with Subfolders…” button in the dialog box. 
The “Add to path with Subfolders” dialog box opens. 
Now, search the “fit-differentiate-integrate” folder by 
single-clicking it and then click the “Select Folder” button thereby 
closing the “Add to path with Subfolders” dialog box. 
Now, in the “Set Path” dialog box, click the “Move to Bottom” 
button in the “Set Path” dialog box. 
Now, select the “tutorials” folder (it should be at the bottom of the 
list) and click the “Remove” button, then click the “Save” button, 
and then click the “Close” button. 
 
You have now completed the installation.
