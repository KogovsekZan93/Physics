%% Description
% 
% Given the values x(i) of the independent variable X and the 
% values y(i) of the dependent variable Y of an arbitrary function 
% Y = f(X), this function returns the value of the integral of the f 
% function with the upper and lower limits of integration xmin and 
% xmax respectively. The integration is performed with a 
% pseudo-order of accuracy Psacc, i.e. the integration is 
% accurate if the f function is a polynomial of the degree of 
% Psacc or less. The integration can either be visualized in the 
% figure figure(figr) if figr is a natural number or not if figr is "0". 
% 
%% Variables
% 
% This function has the form of 
% 
% yIntegralA = ZIntegralA_Revised(xData, yData, 'XIntegralA', ...
%     xIntegralA, 'PseudoAccuracy', psacc, 'Figure', figr, 'Mode', mode)
% 
% xData and yData are the vectors of the aforementioned values 
% xData(i) and yData(i), respectively, of the independent variable 
% X and of the dependent variable Y, respectively, of an arbitrary 
% function Y = f(X) (yData(i) = f(xData(i)). xData and yData both 
% have to be column vectors of real numbers of equal length. 
% xData vector does not have to be sorted (i.e. it is not required 
% that xData(i) > xData(j) for every i > j). 
% 
% xmin is the lower limit of integration and xmax is the upper limit 
% of integration. The limits do not have to be contained in the 
% [min(x), max(x)] interval. 
% 
% Psacc is the pseudo-order of accuracy of the integration, i.e. 
% the integration is accurate if the f function is a polynomial of 
% the degree of Psacc or less. It has to be an integer contained 
% in the interval [0, length(x) – 1]. 
% 
% mode is the selected mode of integration. 
%       If mode == 0, the basic mode of integration will be 
%       performed (see “Pseudo-order of accuracy integration 
%       principle” for further details). 
%       If mode == 1, an augmented mode of the basic mode of 
%       integration will be performed. In this mode, the limits of I(k) 
%       intervals (see “Pseudo-order of accuracy integration 
%       principle” for further details) are augmented so that 
%       Lagrange polynomial extrapolation is averted for every I(k) 
%       possible. 
%       If mode == 2, an augmented mode of the basic mode of 
%       integration will be performed. In this mode, the limits of I(k) 
%       intervals (see “Pseudo-order of accuracy integration 
%       principle” for further details) are augmented so that not 
%       more than 1 + half of x(i) values of the S(k) set are higher 
%       or lower than the limits of I(k) for every I(k) interval 
%       possible. 
% 
% figr is the index of the figure in which the integration will be 
% visualized. It has to be a nonzero integer. If figr == 0, the 
% integration will not be visualized. 
% 
% ZIntegA is the output of the ZIntegralA function and it is the 
% numerical integral of the f function with the limits of integration 
% xmin and xmax with the pseudo-order of accuracy Psacc. 
% 
%% Pseudo-order of accuracy integration principle
% 
% This function uses the GetPointsZIntegralA0 function to divide 
% the X axis into several intervals I(k). In every I(k) interval, there 
% is a set S(k) of Psacc + 1 x(i) values. For each point P in the 
% interval I(k), the x(i) values of S(k) are the closest Psacc + 1 
% x(i) values to the P point. In each I(k) interval, the f function is 
% approximated by the Lagrange polynomial p(k) which is based 
% on {(x(i), y(i)) | x(i) is in S(k)}. This approximation of the function 
% f is then integrated with the limits of integration xmin and xmax. 
% With the GetPointsZIntegralA1 function and the 
% GetPointsZIntegralA2 function, the limits of I(k) intervals are 
% further augmented. See the description of the two functions 
% for further details.
